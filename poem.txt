Queen and King

Queen things lives in a castle
She ate all the pie
Queen feels lonely
She wanted to die

Queen tingz is lying
She doesn't want to die
Queen is very happy
Cause for the first time,
  she felt alive

King was jealous
Wondering happened
King full of hatred
Queen was stabbed by a pen

Secret ending
For once, the king thought of the end
But Queen's vengeance was only starting
She rises up from the dead
And swears to solemnly haunt the King
