Queen and King

Queen things lives in a castle
She ate all the pie
Queen feels lonely
She wanted to die

Queen tingz is lying
She doesn't want to die
Queen is very happy
Cause for the first time,
  she felt alive

King things also lives in the castle
strutting with his gold
King saw queen being happy
He thought, "that girl is bold"

King was jealous
Wondering happened
King full of hatred
Queen was stabbed by a pen
